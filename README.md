-Constraint class stretchcombo for linear combinations of bond length to use with the ASE. 
-Class arpess for performing transition state optimizations through Automated Relaxed Potential Energy Surface Scans (ARPESS).

For usage see the provided examples.
In these examples, stretchcombo is imported from ase.constraints and arpess from ase.optimize.arpess.
